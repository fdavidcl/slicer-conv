# slicer-conv

Convolutional Slicer applied to complexity reduction of COVID-19 chest X-rays. Source code associated to the work "Slicer: Feature Learning for Class Separability with Least-Squares Support Vector Machine Loss and COVID-19 Chest X-ray Case Study" by David Charte, Iván Sevillano-García, María Jesús Lucena-González, José Luis Martín-Rodríguez, Francisco Charte and Francisco Herrera, published on HAIS 2021.

## Usage

This code is prepared to be used with the [COVIDGR-1.0](https://github.com/ari-dasci/OD-covidgr/releases/tag/1.0) cross-validations. `slicer.py` implements the main model and functionality, whereas `slicer-conv.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that can be used to train and run the model interactively.
